1. Reverse a String: Write a function to reverse a given string. For
example, given the input "Hello", the output should be "olleH".
2. Check if a String is Palindrome: Determine whether a given string is
a palindrome, which means it reads the same forwards and
backward. For example, "madam" is a palindrome.
3. Count the Number of Words in a String: Write a function to count the
number of words in a given string. Words are separated by spaces or
punctuation. For example, the input "Hello, world!" should return 2.
4. Check if Two Strings are Anagrams: Given two strings, determine if
they are anagrams, meaning they contain the same characters in a
different order. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.
5. Find the First Non-Repeating Character in a String: Given a string,
find and return the first non-repeating character. For example, in the
string "abracadabra", the first non-repeating character is 'c'.
6. Create an Interface 'Shape' with undefined methods as calculateArea
and calculatePerimeter. Create 2 classes Circle & Square that
implements functionality defined in the Shape Interface. Test your
code.
7. We have to calculate the average of marks obtained in three subjects
by student A and by student B. Create class 'Marks' with an abstract
method 'getPercentage' that will be returning the average percentage
of marks. Provide implementation of abstract method in classes 'A'
and 'B'. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three
subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its
parameters for student B. Test your code
8. Create a Class Car that would have the following fields: carPrice and
color and method calculateSalePrice() which should be returning a
price of the car.
Create 2 sub classes: Sedan and Truck. The Truck class has a field
as weight and has its own implementation of calculateSalePrice()
method in which returned price is calculated as following: if
weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount,
otherwise 20% discount.
The Sedan class has field as length and also does it is own
implementation of calculateSalePrice(): if length of sedan is >20 feet
then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10%
discount
9. Create Registration Class in which you would have variables as
email, userName and password that have an access scope only
within its own class. After creating an object of the class user should
be able to call methods and in each method separately pass values
to set users email, username and password.
Requirements:
A. Valid email consider to be only yahoo
B. Valid userName and password cannot be empty and should be of
length larger than 6 characters. Also valid password cannot contain
userName.
10. Provide Implementation for the diagram below. Then create a test class
in which you need to create Objects of ChromeDriver, FirefoxDrive and
SafariDriver classes and see which methods available to them.
